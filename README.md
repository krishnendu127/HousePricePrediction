# House Price Prediction

## Overview
This project is a machine learning model developed to predict the price of houses based on various features. The model aims to provide accurate estimates for house prices, which can be useful for real estate agencies, homeowners, and property investors.
The project uses a Regressor model to train.


## Features
The project includes the following features:
- Data preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and encoding the input data.
- Feature selection: Identifying relevant features that contribute significantly to the prediction.
- Model training: Utilizing various machine learning algorithms to train the prediction model.
- Model evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics.
